    description: `Ever wanted to include a light little tab or menu or dropdown component but felt like JavaScript or jQuery ui was kinda overkill? Ever thought to yourself that needing jQuery for a simple slide toggle seemed unnecessary...
    Well fret not, you are are not alone. The simple CSS truth is out there!
    You are cordially invited to join us for refreshments, some home-brewed beer (that's actually pretty good if I say so myself), and a talk that explores the use of CSS pseudo-selectors as a trigger for pure CSS slide-toggles, tab switching, expand all/collapse all, accordion menus, drop-down menus, custom checkbox, and radio inputs!
    Wow! No jQuery! So progressive enhance. Very CSS.
    Arrive from 6.30. The talk will start at 7.`,
